# \# 🤖 Intelligent Robotic Manipulation

Welcome to the **Intelligent Robotic Manipulation** project! The objective of this project is to design and implement a robotic system that can **grasp a YCB object** and **place it in a goal basket** while effectively **avoiding obstacles**. This repository includes guidance, code, and configurations to accomplish this.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The project is divided into 5 major tasks:

1. **Perception** - Detect the graspable object using a dual-camera setup.
2. **Control** - Move the robot arm using a custom IK-solver.
3. **Grasping** - Design and execute a grasp strategy.
4. **Localization \& Tracking** - Track and avoid dynamic/static obstacles.
5. **Planning** - Plan a safe trajectory to place the object into a goal receptacle.

## 🔧 Installation \& Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rafey1104/adaptive_pick_and_place_franka_robot.git
cd adaptive_pick_and_place_franka_robot

conda create -n irobman python=3.8
conda activate irobman
conda install pybullet
pip install matplotlib pyyaml

git clone https://github.com/eleramp/pybullet-object-models.git  # inside the irobman_project folder
pip install -e pybullet-object-models/
```

Make sure `pybullet.isNumpyEnabled()` returns True (optional but recommended).

## Running the project
```bash
python3 main.py
```

## 🧠 Tasks Breakdown

### ✅ Task 1: Perception (6D Pose Estimation)

Use a static camera for coarse object detection and an end-effector-mounted camera for fine pose estimation.

Used:

- Global \& ICP Registration
- MegaPose(explored)
- Synthetic masks from PyBullet

---

### ✅ Task 2: Controller (Inverse Kinematics)

Implemented an IK-solver (e.g., pseudo-inverse) for the Franka Panda robot to reach target positions.

### ✅ Task 3: Grasping

Used our IK-based controller and camera to execute object grasps. Begin with fixed objects (e.g., foam brick) and extend to random YCB items.

### ✅ Task 4: Localization \& Tracking

Tracks red sphere obstacles using the static camera setup and visualize obstacle motion.  Used Kalman Filter.

## 📝 Tips

- Use `W` to toggle wireframe mode
- Press `J` to display axes in GUI
- Disable cam output to speed up simulation
- Use debug GUI and log intermediate outputs
